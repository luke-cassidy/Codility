    - Added GenomicRangeQuery lesson in Java with unit tests (solution with non optimal time complexity)

12. `30/06/2020`
    - Modified GenomicRangeQuery lesson to include fix that reduced time complexity.
    - Solution inspired by 'https://github.com/Mickey0521/Codility' solution on GitHub

13. `20/08/2020`
